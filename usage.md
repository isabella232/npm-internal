npm-internal needs to be configured.

You can place a .npm-internalrc file in your current directory, in your home directory.
See all the ways to set the config: https://github.com/dominictarr/rc#standards

Usage:

npm-internal config
  This prompts you for config options and then saves them to $HOME/.npm-internalrc

npm-internal publish
  This builds a npm package, and uploads it to your s3 bucket.
